/**

 * port, answering whatever a test scripts and recording exactly what arrived.
 *
 * <p><b>A deliberate per-repository copy</b>, of the same shape qits-ci keeps, and duplicated for
 * the reason both {@code FakeContainerRuntime}s are: the modules do not share a test classpath, the
 * client jar's own stub is package-private in a jar this repository consumes, and a test-jar to
 * bridge sixty lines would couple this suite to another repository's fixtures. The JDK server rather
 * than Vert.x, for the same reason it uses one — no web stack has to be dragged in to prove a header
 * went out.
 *
 * <p><b>Deliberately dumb.</b> It routes nothing, validates nothing and holds no registry: a test
 * says which status and which body it wants back, and what is under test is the launcher's reading
 * of the four answers those become. What the real routes answer is proved against the real service
 * in qits-containers' own suite; this stub exists for the cases a real service will not produce on
 * demand — a 503, a connection nothing accepts — and for reading the request line off the wire.
