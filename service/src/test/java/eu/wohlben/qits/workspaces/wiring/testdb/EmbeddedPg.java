/**
 * One real PostgreSQL for this module's whole surefire JVM.
 *
 * <p><b>Why not a container.</b> The first rule of this repo is that a clone builds and tests green
 * with no docker, and this context's store is postgres now — so Testcontainers and Quarkus dev
 * services are both out, and the schema still has to be exercised against the database it actually
 * ships on (V1's partial unique index exists on no other). Zonky resolves real postgres binaries as
 * ordinary Maven artifacts and this class spawns them as a child process: a dependency, not a
 * daemon.
 *
 * <p><b>It is copied per module rather than shared</b>, because sharing it would mean a test-jar
 * dependency between two modules that deliberately have none — the same reason the {@code Fake*}
 * doubles are duplicated. {@code domain} carries its own copy. The databases are named per (module,
 * datasource) for the same reason a container would be: two suites on one host must not be able to
 * mean the same name.
 *
 * <p><b>The instance is tracked in a system property, not in this static field alone.</b> A Quarkus
 * test run loads config sources in more than one classloader, so a second copy of this class is
 * loaded with its own statics; the property is the one thing they share, and it is what keeps the
 * count at one postgres per JVM instead of one per classloader.
