/**
 * What the native image owes the containers client, and nothing else lives here.
 *
 * <p>The second member of the family {@code bus/EventWireReflection} opened, and it exists for the
 * identical reason: {@code ContainersJson} builds its <b>own</b> {@code ObjectMapper} — so a
 * consuming application's customizers cannot reach what the client puts on a wire — and a mapper
 * built by hand is invisible to the build step that scans for what needs reflecting on. Without this
 * class the JVM suite stays green and the deployed binary fails on <em>every</em> call, which is
 * exactly what a missing {@code EventWireReflection} cost the platform on 2026-08-06.
 *
 * <p><b>Both directions are on the list, and a record this service only sends needs it as much as
 * one it reads</b>: on the writing side an unregistered record has no components to find. The list
 * is closed, every entry is nested in one class, and the client's own README carries it as a paste
 * rather than a derivation. <b>A JVM test cannot catch a missing entry</b> — on a JVM these types
 * reflect whether anyone registered them or not — so the guard is that this list and that README are
 * the same list.
