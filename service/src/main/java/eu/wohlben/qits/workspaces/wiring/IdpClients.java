/**
 * qits-idp's commission API — the second call this service makes to another service, and the only
 * one that mints anything.
 *
 * <p><b>The path is a cross-repo contract.</b> {@code /api/clients} is served under qits-idp's own
 * {@code /idp} segment, which is what the configured base url carries — and that base is {@code
 * quarkus.oidc-client.auth-server-url}, the address this service already holds because it fetches
 * tokens from the same place. Deriving it means there is no second address to configure and no way
 * for the two to disagree about which idp this is.
 *
 * <p><b>Authorization is HTTP Basic, and the credential is this service's own idp client.</b> That
 * is the whole mechanism qits-idp offers here and it adds nothing to configure: a caller already
 * holds an id and a secret, which is how it gets tokens at all. It travels as an explicit {@code
 * @HeaderParam} rather than through a filter so the one place that composes it is the one place that
 * reads the keys — {@link IdpCredentialCommissioner}.
