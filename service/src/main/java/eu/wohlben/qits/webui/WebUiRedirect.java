/**
 * {@code /workspaces} → {@code /workspaces/}, and nothing else.
 *
 * <p>Quinoa mounts the web client at {@code /workspaces/*}, which does not match the bare segment — so
 * before this route existed, typing {@code /workspaces} into a browser answered 404 while
 * {@code /workspaces/} served the client. Upstream behaviour, but not a defensible surface: the segment
 * is this service's to serve in every spelling, and the bare one means "take me to the client".
 *
 * <p>GET and HEAD only — the bare segment has no meaning for a write, and a machine client POSTing
 * here gets a 405 rather than a bounce at HTML. 301, because the answer will never be anything
 * else, and the query string travels. The same route, for the same reason, exists in qits-ci and
 * qits-artifacts.
