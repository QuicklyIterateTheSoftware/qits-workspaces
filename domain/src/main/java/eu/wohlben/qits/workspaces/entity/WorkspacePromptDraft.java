/**
 * A workspace's persisted prompt-composition draft — one row per workspace, rehydrated on load so a
 * half-built prompt survives a refresh (and follows the operator across devices). The draft is
 * <em>semi-opaque</em>: {@link #content} is a JSON document the composing UI owns and the server
 * never interprets, while {@link #serializedPrompt} is the launch-ready markdown the client already
 * produced — the server-readable part a later step's {@code taskPrompt} MCP tool serves to the
 * agent.
 *
 * <p>The primary key <em>is</em> the owning {@link Workspace}'s {@code id} ({@code
 * workspace_id_fk}, a shared PK/FK): the draft is strictly 1:1 with a workspace, so no separate
 * generated id is needed. The workspace row is soft-deleted, so the on-delete-cascade FK never
 * fires in the normal discard flow — {@code WorkspaceService.doDiscard} deletes this row
 * explicitly.
 *
 * <p>{@code @Uncaused} by decision, twice over. No row here is ever written through Hibernate:
 * {@code WorkspacePromptDraftRepository.upsert} is a native {@code insert … on conflict}, so
 * {@code @PrePersist} — and with it the {@code CausationStamp} — cannot fire at all. And the row is
 * an updatable singleton, rewritten by every autosave, so even a hand-set value would name one
 * edit and then misname every one after it.
