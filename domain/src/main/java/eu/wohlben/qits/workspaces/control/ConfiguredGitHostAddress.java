/**
 * The shipped {@link GitHostAddress}: {@code qits.githost.url} plus the <b>public</b> {@code
 * /git/<projectId>/<repoName>} route qits-githost serves.
 *
 * <p><b>The public route, not the storage-UUID one.</b> qits-githost keys a repository internally by
 * its row id (a per-instance UUID) and serves that id at {@code /git/<repoId>} — but the repository
 * identity ruling reserves that route for the qits-projects client alone; every other consumer,
 * this service included, is answered <b>403</b> there. The address every consumer clones, fetches
 * and pushes through is the public one, {@code /git/<projectId>/<repoName>}: the pair a clone url, a
 * committed pipeline and a person all spell, and the same one the in-container workspace-daemon
 * already self-clones under. So this bean resolves the id it is handed to that pair before building
 * the url — the mirror directories stay keyed by row id (that is {@code RepoMirror}'s business), but
 * the remote is name-addressed.
 *
 * <p><b>The git host is qits-githost, not qits-artifacts.</b> The byte-plane split moved the git
 * smart-HTTP server into a service of its own — a repository is not an artifact, it only shared the
 * storage layout — so both the key and the route segment moved with it. The old spelling was {@code
 * qits.artifacts.url} plus {@code /artifacts/git/<repoId>}; a deployment still passing
 * {@code QITS_ARTIFACTS_URL} configures nothing now, which is the loud failure rather than the
 * quiet one of pushing every ref at a service that no longer serves git.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code @DefaultBean}, exactly as {@code HttpRepositoryLookup} is.</b> It yields to any other
 * bean of the type, which is what lets a test double point the push at a local bare with no change
 * on the production side. Keep the annotation: dropping it makes the two an ambiguous dependency
 * and the build fails at {@code ArcProcessor#validate}, for every test at once.
 *
 * <p>The path segment is spelled here and not configured. It is the git host's contract, not a
 * deployment's choice — {@code GitHostRoutes.BASE} in qits-githost is the same literal — and a
 * second copy in a properties file would be a second place for it to drift.
