/**
 * A framework-free description of one workspace container — what it is called, what it runs, what
 * it mounts and what it is allowed. It accumulates those parameters through fluent setters and
 * hands them back through same-named readers; it renders nothing and knows no runtime.
 *
 * <p><b>It used to render a {@code docker run} argv</b> ({@code toRunArgv}), because the host held
 * the docker socket and this was the last thing before {@code ProcessBuilder}. The socket is gone —
 * qits-containers owns the daemon and this service asks it over HTTP — so the flag order, the
 * repeated {@code -e}/{@code -v}/{@code --label} spellings and the {@code -d --init} prefix all went
 * with the process they were being assembled for. What is left is the part that was never about
 * docker: the set of decisions a workspace container is made of. {@code containershost/
 * WorkspaceContainers} is the one place that turns them into the orchestrator's wire spec, and it is
 * the only reader of this class outside its own tests.
 *
 * <p>Callers do not construct this directly with the cross-cutting config; they obtain a pre-seeded
 * instance from {@link WorkspaceContainerFactory} (which guarantees the shared credential volume,
 * the {@code qits.*} labels, the docker-host alias and the host uid are always present) and only
 * add what varies.
 *
 * <p><b>Insertion order is preserved for the labels, the environment and the mounts</b>, and that is
 * a property rather than an accident: the spec assembled from them is asserted literally by the
 * adapter's own test, and a set's iteration order is not a thing to assert against.
