/**
 * A single image attached to a workspace's prompt draft — a sketch export or a pasted screenshot,
 * stored as its own row (n:1 with the workspace) rather than base64 inside the draft's opaque
 * {@code content} blob. Keeping the bytes here keeps the blob small, lets the server enforce a
 * per-image cap and a PNG/JPEG magic-byte sniff at upload time, and is what a later step's {@code
 * taskPrompt} MCP tool turns into {@code ImageContent} blocks. The opaque blob references these
 * rows by {@link #id} only.
 *
 * <p>The {@code workspace_id_fk} FK is {@code on delete cascade}, but the workspace row is only
 * soft-deleted, so that cascade never fires in practice — {@code WorkspaceService} (and {@code
 * WorkspacePromptDraftService.deleteDraft}) delete these rows explicitly, same as {@link
 * WorkspacePromptDraft}.
 *
 * <p>{@code @Uncaused} by decision, following the draft it is the payload of. These rows are
 * pre-launch composition state rather than a durable record: they arrive one browser paste at a
 * time through {@code WorkspacePromptAttachmentController} — the only writer, and one with no
 * machine caller that could carry an {@code X-Qits-Causation-Id} — and they are deleted wholesale
 * with the draft and on {@code WorkspaceResolved}. A column that only a human's browser could fill,
 * on a row that does not outlive the composition, buys nothing the draft does not already decline.
